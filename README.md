 # JS_API

 This is a tiny bit of code (an api to be exact) crafted with love by me to enjoy the beauty of <br>
 code with JavaScript and server set-up
 
 ## Functionality
 For the moment, this is only 'to-do list' with simple commands :
  - **GET** [ EMPTY REQUEST ] <br>
  -> To get the whole to do list as a JSON array
  - **POST** [ JSON ARRAY FORMAT : { "id" : (nbr), "name" : "(name)" ] <br>
  -> To add a new entry in your list
  - **PUT** [ JSON ARRAY FORMAT : { "id" : (nbr), "name" : "(name)"] <br>
  -> Doesn't work right now, soon to be patched.
  - **DELETE** [ JSON ARRAY FORMAT : { "id" : (nbr), "name" : "(name)"] <br>
  -> Delete the selected (id) item from the list.
